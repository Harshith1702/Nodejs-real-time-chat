# Node.js Real-Time Chat Application

A real-time chat application built using Node.js and Express that allows multiple users to exchange messages instantly within a local environment. This project focuses on understanding real-time communication flow, server–client interaction, and handling multiple connected users.

## Key Features
- Real-time messaging between multiple users
- Handles multiple client connections
- Simple and responsive user interface
- Local server-based application
- Lightweight and easy to run

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshith1702/Nodejs-real-time-chat
   ```
  
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Nodejs-real-time-chat
   ```

6. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
